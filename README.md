# TFA-Modlists

This repository contains all active TFA modlists. If you'd like to make changes to a mod list, please fork and make a pull request, or make an Issue. 
Please include the mod or mods in the title of the issue or PR. 

## Viewing the lists

Because *reasons*, we can't show what's in these lists in a not-HTML form. To make them viewable, right click on the `Raw` button, and select `Save link as...`

## Mission building with TFA modlists

Regardless of your personal mod taste (as we allow you to use non-gameplay affecting mods), you *must not* use any mods not in the mod list *including* Zeus mods such as Achillies or Zeus Enhanced. Both Zeus Enhanced and Achillies will be running on the server, so Zeus' can pick the one they prefer.

If you started making your campaign before this came into effect (I know of at least one, because I've given them guidance) then you will not be required to use this list. If you've not started making missions, please consider using this list, as it will be required once we've got it set in concrete. 

## Why this is necessary

There's often significant debate about which mod list is "correct", and it's easy to lose track of files when they're scattered across numerous Discord channels. I hope that, by placing them in a centralised location and introducing change control, it will be possible to eliminate those issues entirely.
