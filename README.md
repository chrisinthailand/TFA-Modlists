# TFA-Modlists

This repository contains all active TFA modlists. If you'd like to make changes to a mod list, please fork and make a pull request, or make an Issue. 
Please include the mod or mods in the title of the issue or PR. 

## Mission building with TFA modlists

Regardless of your personal mod taste (as we allow you to use non-gameplay affecting mods), you *must not* use any mods not in the mod list *including* Zeus mods such as Achillies or Zeus Enhanced. Both Zeus Enhanced and Achillies will be running on the server, so Zeus' can pick the one they prefer.

## Why this is necessary

There's often significant debate about which mod list is "correct", and it's easy to lose track of files when they're scattered across numerous Discord channels. I hope that, by placing them in a centralised location and introducing change control, it will be possible to eliminate those issues entirely.
